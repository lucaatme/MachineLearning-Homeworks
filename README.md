# Machine Learning Homeworks
## A.Y. 2022/2023


These are my solutions to the homeworks proposed during one of the many Machine Learning courses in the academic year 2022/2023. Such homeworks covered some of the most important topics described during the lectures, mainly
- Linear Regression
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Neural Networks ~ Clustering

The folder of each homework contains the dataset (when required) and the _.ipynb_ notebooks should be run [locally](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks) or on an instance of Jupyter (using anaconda for example) in the same folder as the one of the dataset to allow for a correct access to the files.
